NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaData::BuiltWith - Report what versions of
    things your distribution was built against

VERSION
    version 0.01005122

SYNOPSIS
      [MetaData::BuiltWith]
      include = Some::Module::Thats::Not::In::Preq
      exclude = Some::Module::Youre::Ashamed::Of
      show_uname = 1           ; default is 0
      uname_call = uname        ; the default
      uname_args = -s -r -m -p  ; the default is -a

DESCRIPTION
    Often, distribution authors get module dependencies wrong. So in such
    cases, its handy to be able to see what version of various packages they
    built with.

    Some would prefer to demand everyone install the same version as they
    did, but that's also not always necessary.

    Hopefully, the existence of the metadata provided by this module will
    help users on their end machines make intelligent choices about what
    modules to install in the event of a problem.

METHODS
  mvp_multivalue_args
    This module can take, as parameters, any volume of 'exclude' or
    'include' arguments.

  metadata
    This module scrapes together the name of all modules that exist in the
    ""Prereqs"" section that Dist::Zilla collects, and then works out what
    version of things you have, applies the various include/exclude rules,
    and ships that data back to Dist::Zilla via this method. See
    "Dist::Zilla"'s "MetaProvider" role for more details.
