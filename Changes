 [00_Note]

 [Features]
 - new 'show_config' option which extracts selected interesting data from
   Config.pm ( such as the git ID ), which should prove useful for showing
   exactly what perl a dist was built on
 - greatly improved option documentation.

0.02000100 2012-02-27T04:05:24Z

0.02000000 2012-02-27T03:48:01Z
 [Bugfixes]
 - This release should hopefully neuter the occasional glitch that occured
   due to $_ being clobbered in a few places yeilding a package of 'undef',
   which emits broken META.yml. Hopefully this should resolve rt#63930

 - MooseX::Types::Moose

 [Dependencies::Changed / develop suggests]

 - Ripped out the Autobox stuff as it was adding errors.
 - Used MooseX::Types instead of simple stringy ones.
 - Used Recent Moose traits to provide flattening instead of Autobox.
 - include and exclude are now _include and _exclude with init_args to keep
   construction the same. new methods include and exclude are 'elements'
   accessors.
 - _uname_args now produces _all_uname_args 'elements' trait-accessor.
